This repo is a fork from the course material repo of a JavaScript course. I took this course at Laurea University of Applied Sciences. Assignment submissions can be found within the instruction files, as per the course submission policy (`workshop#x.html`). In addition, this repo contains some additional exercises for practicing JS (the `examples` folder), as well as code demos from lectures (`class demos` folder).

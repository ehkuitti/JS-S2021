_Please don't mind the fact that the names of some files and directories in the repo are partly in Finnish. This is due to it being the language of instruction on this course._

This repo is a fork from the course material repo of a JavaScript course. I took this course at Laurea University of Applied Sciences. Assignment submissions can be found within the instruction files, as per the course submission policy (`workshop#x.html`). In addition, this repo contains some additional exercises for practicing JS (the `esimerkkej√§` folder), as well as code demos from lectures (`tuntidemot` folder).
